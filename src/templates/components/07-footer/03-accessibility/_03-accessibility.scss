// In the context of a full page, consider the following:
//
// - Ensure headings are marked up correctly with the right ranking.
//   For example if you have an `<h1>` page heading followed by a Fooer heading, that should be marked up as an `<h2>`.
// - If placed on a non-white background, ensure the contrast between the icons and its background still meets
//   the [AAA contrast and luminosity ratio standard of 4.5:1](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
// - Ensure that the <footer> eleement is used appropriately in context of global placement
// - Ensure that the footer element is marked up correctly if one of many on the page
