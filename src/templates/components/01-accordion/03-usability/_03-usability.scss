// Usability guidance
//
// - Avoid traditional accordions that only open 1 section at a time â€” people with cognitive impairments may find it hard to remember what they have read.
// - Give users full control over what content is visible.
// - Write accordion headings in plain English so users can quickly see if they need to open the accordion or not.
//   You could write 'if' headings, such as 'If you'll use your marriage certificate overseas'.
// - It must be possible to print the accordion information.
