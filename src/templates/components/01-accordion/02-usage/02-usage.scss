// Usage
//
// Do use:
// - if you want to show a list of sections and sub-sections
// - if you want to publish information that's not for most people. This is sometimes called an edge case,
// for example only some people need to know information about using a New Zealand marriage certificate overseas.
//
// Don't use:
//
// - if it's information that's important to most users
// - if you only want to shorten a page.
