// Accessibility
//
// The component has the following features to support accessibility:
//
// - Accordion controls show focus when using tab key and are accessible using a keyboard.
// - The accordion has a dynamic tab order that takes account of the opening and closing of sections.
//
// In the context of a full page, consider the following:
//
// - Ensure headings are marked up correctly with the right ranking.
//   For example if you have an `<h1>` page heading followed by an accordion the accordion heading should be marked up as an `<h2>`.
// - Accordion controls must be placed in the correct tab order in their page context.
// - If placed on a non-white background, ensure the contrast between the accordion text and its background still meets
//   the [AAA contrast and luminosity ratio standard of 4.5:1](http:www.rte.ie).
